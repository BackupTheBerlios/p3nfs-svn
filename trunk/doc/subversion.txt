Some notes on Subversion usage within p3nfs.

The mainstream development line resides in 'trunk'


After a release, tag trunk under 'tags'.
Example given:

Say that 5.43 is released and
your Berlios account is hekker
then do

 svn copy \
  svn+ssh:hekker@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/p3nfs/trunk \
  svn+ssh:hekker@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/p3nfs/tags/5.43


Non-mainstream development should be done in 'branches'
Contact the other developers before you create a branch. 


IMPORTANT:

   Subversion is NOT a communication tool,
   use it only for Source Code Mangament
   and communicate with your fellow-developers
   through other channels as 'svn'


The mailinglist p3nfs-svn@lists.berlios.de does mail
the commit messages. Developers are expected to be subscribed
to that ML. More info
at http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/admin/p3nfs-svn


Subversion ignores files like 'a.out' and '*.o'
To ignore more files, put them in '.svnignore' and do
 svn propset svn:ignore -F .svnignore .
