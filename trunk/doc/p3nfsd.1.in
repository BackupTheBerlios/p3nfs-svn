.SH NAME
p3nfsd \- Mount Epoc / SymbianOS filesystems
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B p3nfsd <client-type> [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B p3nfsd
makes the filesystems of most 
.I SymbianOS
based PDAs and phones available to an attached Unix computer.
.B p3nfs
talks to the local UNIX machine via NFS,
and uses its own protocol to talk with its client program on the PDA/phone.
The connection can be established via a Serial cable, IrDA, Bluetooth or USB.
.PP
As first option you have to define the client type to connect. These options
preconfigure p3nfs for the corresponding device, in most cases you won't need
further options. To list the preconfigures options type
.B p3nfsd <client-type> -h

.SH PDA/Phone counterparts
P3nfsd needs a client program on the PDA/Phone.
Depending on the PDA/Phone you have, you have different options, read the
.B CLIENT-TYPE
section for details.
These programs can be found
along with the detailed HOWTOs in the documentation directory, which is
@prefix@/share/doc/p3nfs-@VERSION@

.SH CLIENT-TYPE
In most cases you only have to specify the client type, p3nfsd tries to set the
correct parameters for this client. Type p3nfsd <client-type>
.B -h
to see the defaults for this client-type.
.TP
.B -series3
for Psion Series 3. See
.I /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/Epoc16
for a more detailed HOWTO. As client you have to use
.B nfsc3.opl
.TP
.B -series3a
for Psion Series 3a / Series 3c / Series 3mx / Sienna . See
.I /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/Epoc16
for a more detailed HOWTO. As client you can either use
.B nfsc3a.opl
or
.B nfsc.app
which comes with a builtin VT100 emulator.
Note: You cannot use the Infrared interface of the Series3c as it is not IrDA
compliant.
.TP
.B -series5
for Psion Series 5 / Series 5mx / Ericsson MC218 . As client you can use
.B nfsc5.opl
or
.B nfsapp,
the latter one comes as an application with its own SIS
file (nfsapp-2.5-epocR5.sis).
.B nfsapp
supports cable and IrDA for this architecture.
For a HOWTO see
.I /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/Epoc32_R5
.TP
.B -series60
for Series 60 Phones like the Nokia 3650, 7650 and Siemens SX1.
The client is 
.B nfsapp
(nfsapp-2.5-series60.sis), and it supports IrDA
and Bluetooth in the Series60 version. The HOWTO is
.I /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/Epoc32_R6
and
.I /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/bluetooth.linux
respectively.
.TP
.B -crystal
for the Nokia 92x0 Communicator. 
The client is 
.B nfsapp
(nfsapp-2.5-crystal.sis), and it supports serial cable or IrDA.
The detailed HOWTO is
.I /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/Epoc32_R6
.TP
.B -UIQ
for UIQ Phones like the Sony-Ericsson P800.
The client is
.B nfsapp
(nfsapp-2.5-UIQ.sis), and it supports IrDA, Bluetooth
and the connection over the USB docking station. The HOWTOs are
.I /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/Epoc32_R6,
.I /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/bluetooth.linux
and
.I /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/usb.linux
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -conn <prog>
Start
.B <prog>
after the connection is established. E.g. to do automatic backups.
.TP
.B -dir <directory>
Use
.B <directory>
as mount point instead of the default /mnt/psion. The directory has to be empty.
.TP
.B -disconn <prog>
Start
.B <prog>
after the connection is finished.
.TP
.B -epoc32_filesystem
Needed for a connection with a Epoc32 based device. You should not specify
this option explicitely.
.TP
.B -nobackground
Do not go to background after mounting, used mostly for debugging.
.TP
.B -noflow
Do not use hardware flowcontrol. Needed e.g. for the Nokia Communicator.
.TP
.B -oldnfsc
Use the "old" protocol. Certain clients need this.
.TP
.B -shell prog
When using the Epoc16 client 
.B nfsc
you can have a UNIX shell on the PDA.
This option selects the shell program.
.TP
.B -speed <baud>
The baudrate used for communication.
.TP
.B -tcp
This options selects TCP as communication interface.
.TP
.B -timeout <msec>
The timeout for the communication with the client. Some clients/protocols
need bigger timeouts. Use this option with care.
.TP
.B -tty <dev>
The serial device used for communication (not valid for TCP).
Linux examples: 
.I /dev/ttyS0
for Serial cable,
.I /dev/ircomm0
for IrDA,
.I /dev/rfcomm0
for bluetooth.
.TP
.B -user <uid>
The files of the PDA/Phone should be accessible by <uid> only. Default is the
uid of the caller. This option is only available when p3nfsd is started by
the root user.
.TP
.B -v
Be more verbose. You can increase the debug level after p3nfsd is started by
sending a SIGUSR1 signal to p3nfsd or accessing <mountpoint>/debug.
The output is written to stdout.
You can increase debugging from 0 to 3 and then back to 0 again.
.TP
.B -wakeup
Psion Series3* devices only. Specifying this option can wake up the device, if
the cable switch is set accordingly.
.SH Terminating p3nfsd
Make sure that no process has open files / current working directory on
the PDA filesystem. Then access the file <mountpoint>/exit, with e.g.
"ls /mnt/psion/exit" or ":> /mnt/psion/exit". You should receive the error
message: File exists. After 2 seconds p3nfsd will try to unmount the directory
and exit.

.SH BUGS
p3nfs may hang your shell, if it cannot connect to the client.
The following procedure might help you to recover without booting
the host system:

First kill the program which tries to access the PDA filesystem. In some cases
you have to wait some minutes until the process dies, even if killed with -KILL.
Then either try to terminate p3nfsd normally (see above), or kill p3nfsd
.B and
unmount the <mountpoint> manually.
