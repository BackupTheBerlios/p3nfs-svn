p3nfs (5.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #181691). I no longer have a Psion, so I
    have no idea if that actually *works*. This package is RFA'd for a
    reason.
  * Update debian/copyright to include correct upstream location (Closes: #203204)
  * Fix "Debian/GNU Linux" (urgh) (Closes: #126978)
  * Copy updated description from upstream webpage (Closes: #125211)

p3nfs (5.4-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild due to bogus shared library versioning. (closes: #97848)

 -- Steve Haslam <araqnid@debian.org>  Fri, 18 May 2001 19:53:49 +0100

p3nfs (5.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changing tactic: copy the nfs_mount.h from kernel 2.0.39 and use that
    instead of trying to use linux/nfs_mount.h from glibc. Since p3nfs
    predates NFS3 support in the kernel, trying to use a recent NFS header
    seems hideously unreliable. The kernel ought to see that the "version"
    field is low and compensate accordingly.
    (bug #96805 is a symptom)
  * Added Build-Depends on debhelper to control
  * Updated Standards-Version
  * Removed /psion/mnt directory

 -- Steve Haslam <araqnid@debian.org>  Wed,  9 May 2001 17:33:03 +0100

p3nfs (5.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved files from /usr/lib/p3nfs/nfsc to /usr/share/p3nfs/nfsc
  * Copy the 'opl' directory to /usr/share/p3nfs/opl (Closes: #40902)
  * Missed from previous version: (Closes: #91014, #91595)
  * Might have fixed #84499, but need confirmation.

 -- Steve Haslam <araqnid@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Apr 2001 16:32:37 +0100

p3nfs (5.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt to fix paths.
  * Fiddle with include files to get it to build with latest glibc. Since I don't
    currently have a working Psion, i can't test this. This package needs adoption.

 -- Steve Haslam <araqnid@debian.org>  Sun, 29 Apr 2001 16:13:05 +0100

p3nfs (5.4-3) unstable; urgency=low
