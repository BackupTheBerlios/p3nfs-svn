Please refer to /usr/share/doc/p3nfs/README for the usage.

Before using it,
transfer /usr/share/p3nfs/epoc16/opl/nfsc3.opl
or /usr/share/p3nfs/epoc16/nfsc/nfsc.app to your Psion 3.

On Psion 5 and other Symbian you
transfer /usr/share/p3nfs/epoc32/opl/nfsc5.opl
or /usr/share/p3nfs/epoc32/nfsapp to the "client"

You have to run p3nfsd as root, since it wants to use NFS.
Another alternative is to make it setuid root.
