frontend
	Graphical TCL frontend to mount / unmount your psion.

nfsc.termcap
	A description of the nfsc (epoc16) terminal capabilities.
	If your system is using termcap (there is an /etc/termcap file)
	then append this file to your /etc/termcap, and set TERM to nfsc.

nfsc.terminfo.src
	This is the same as nfsc.termcap, but for terminfo based systems.
	You have to compile it with tic.

s5magic
	Append this file to /etc/magic (if your systems supports it),
	so if you're using the command file on your mounted s5, you get
	some nice explanations of the file-types.
