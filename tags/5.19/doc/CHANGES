pl1 Fri Feb 4 1994
  - Setting VTIME to 10 (1 second) to avoid lockups by read
  - Automatic wakeup (by Toerless Eckert).
pl2 Wed Feb 9 1994
  - protocol between psion&sun changed slightly -> nfsc.opl has to
    be updated.
  - Select before read (hopefully less lockups now)
  - Starting without psion attached (for starting p3nfsd at boottime)
pl3 Sun Feb 13 1994
  - select now works (without stuff/error correction)
  - all 32 bytes of an nfs_fh are important...not only the first 4 (pwd works)
  - rename bug fixed.
  - extensively tested
pl4 Sat Mar 19 1994
  - p3nfsd should work now on hpux (biod's has to be stopped).
  - large files can be written / udp buffer space enlarged.
pl5 (????)
  - Thank Juergen it should work on Linux
pl6 (Around July 15.)
  - AIX port. Strange lockups when writing a file twice. (?!)
pl7 (17.8.94) (from version.h)
  - AIX port (untested) by Rudi.
  - Lee McLoughlin updated the linux port.
pl8 (13.10.94)
  - possibly help for classic S3 users. added untested nfsc_S3.opl
  - Added preliminary Solaris 2.3 support. gec
  - Made it gcc -Wall free.
    (30.08.94)
  - uadd for S3 classic added by Volker Lausch.
pl9 (27.11.94)
  - TIOCEXCL, retry on timeout.
pl10 (28.02.95)
  - Dan Danz has missing files. Addentry() seems broken.
  - Rudi fixes his XDR encapsualtion in addentry().
pl11 (09.05.95)
  - /etc/mtab mode now preserved.
pl12 (24.09.95)
  - N.N. implements nfsc in C.
  - Rudi sets E_MAX_PRIORITY and nfs_args.retrans=2
pl13 (15.10.95)
  - menu driven version of nfsc.c
Version 4 (1.96)
  - nfsc.c from N.N. modified:
    - added crc for read / write
    - changed protocol: new one = PREFIX byte (0x80) + old protocol
      change was made to allow for simultanous terminal emulator + nfsd
    - terminal emulator (vt100/vt220 subset)
      Supports the standard psion fonts, if used with nfsd, resize
      generates a window change event for the unix process.
      Minimal support for alternate charset (font not complete).
  - new nfsd options:
    -oldnfsc for the old protocol (no prefix & crc, used with the opl)
    -shell (fork "login" shell, new nfsc version only)
  - mount option retries set to 10, it should ensure less nfs timeouts.
  - default user is taken from LOGNAME.
  - Solaris compiles now without warnings
  - IBM CodePage850 to ISO8859-1 conversion for filenames & terminal emulator
  - Jumpscroll for the emulator
pl2 (4.96)
  - IRIX port
  - security patches -> should be safe to install suid now
  - cache rewrite (& solaris mount option fix)
  - linux tcdrain enabled
  - xymodem
  - minor nfsc tuning
pl3 (16.5.96)
  - Linux 1.3.97 sends 8kbyte nfs frames (1.2.13 : 1kbyte). The Linux
    serial buffer is 4k, i.e p3nfsd can't write a whole frame in a single
    write. Select doesn't work under Linux for checking if write is possible.
    Fix: we are now flushing the serial line after each "bad" write. Enabled
    with the define NO_WRITE_SELECT in config.h
    (Bugreport by Keith Parks)
  - ISO8859-1 Filename conversion fix i.e tolower(a-umlaut)
  - Function key support for nfsc (defineable keys with load/save support)
  - There is a "No VT100 Emulator" version of the nfsc client (nfscnovt.app)
    in the distribution.
      VT100 Emulation code + XYMODE support: 10k
      NFSC support: 2k
      serial line support + global routines: 7k
pl3a (19.5.96, after a mail from Odd Gripenstam, nfsc changes only)
  - Vt100 bugfix: ESC[;0r resets the scroll region now.
  - Emulator logging implemented
  - etc\fnkeys.nfs by Odd Gripenstam
pl3b (27.5.96)
  - "disable logging" bug fixed
pl3c (17.6.96)
  - Directory structure changed a bit, as nfsc is distributed now as a 
    package on his own.
pl3d (22.6.96)
  - nfsd Makefile tuned to follow restructuring (cnv.h)
  - nfsc: (Ideas by Ed Arnowitz)
    Hangup implemented (untested)
    FnKey editing allowed
    Xmodem filename mustn't exist
    24 rows support
    Menus compacted
pl4 (1.9.96)
  - The old (and already fixed in version pl2?) mount option bug for solaris
    is fixed again. Thanks to David Jackson <david@cogency.co.uk> for his
    bug report.

    bash, konqueror and nautilus seem to like utf-8 (RedHat 9)

    to be able to change bluetooth address, TCP/IP address,
    default IO port and debug level whithout recompiling.

5.17 Thu Apr 21 17:19:42 MEST 2005
- nfsclient:
  Async write disabled, as we got problems when writing to Flash:
  A popup from the OS appears: "Cannot finish writing to the disk"
  (loosely translated from german)
  The write-speed does not seem to be much lower, but no real tests conducted
  The EpocR5 version should work again...
- a blutooth correlated bug which only appears on newer phones fixed
